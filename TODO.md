# TODO

#### Features
- **Two Player Mode:** Add a two player mode, where the players can compete against each other.

#### Improvements
- **Center of Rotation Check:** Verify the center of rotation for Z and S tetrominoes and adjust accordingly.
- **Pre-Solidification Movement:** To improve the feel of the game, the player should be able to move after a sort time before the tetromino solidifies.
- **Save Game:** Save hiscores and settings in a save file.
- **Options Menu:** Add an options menu instead of having all the options in the main menu.

#### Code
- `drawNextTetromino`: Doing a monkey patch to show as centered as posible I and T tetrominoes, maybe we can find a better way to do this.
